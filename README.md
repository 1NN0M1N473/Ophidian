# Ophidian
Ophidian is a new project of mine. Intended to manifest at least initially as a Discord &amp; Slack bot, it will serve as an all-in-one tool for pentesters, threat hunters, and IR specialists alike. The feature list is incomplete at this point as it's more of an idea than anything else, but I intend to integrate it with several APIs such as MetaDefender, VirusTotal, any.run and more to provide a quick and easy threat lookup, as well as easy access to open source database searches such as exploitdb and such. A more detailed description and initial code will be added as I get time to work on the project.
